          at your high school. But if not, feel free to learn along as well. This
          course will teach you how to make your own website that could be your personal
          portfolio, a website about your iwi/ancestry or even for a side hustle.
          We don't want you to make a cookie-cutter barely passable site, we want
          you to come out with something that will last a lifetime. This website
          will be a reflection of you, so we want it to be <span
