    Astro Media was founded in early 2023, because we noticed the lack of
    quality websites in New Zealand, we discovered that many small businesses
    were still using old websites that were slow and often had confusing
    layouts. <br />
    <br />

    This lead to Jack Gong, a Software Engineering student and Otis Wales, a
    Computer Science student to come together in order to make changes in this
    landscape.

    <br />
    <br />
    Our primary mission is to deliver great websites, which result in <span
      class="text-primary"
      >high conversions.
