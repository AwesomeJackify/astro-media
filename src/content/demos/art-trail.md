title: Hidden Gems Lost Landscapes Art Trail
description:
  This art trail covers some of the most incredible hidden natural areas in the Albert Eden area. You will discover the oldest lava forest in the country, the remnants of the Cabbage Tree Lake, and the restored aquifer-fed wetland on Roy Clements Treeway. These landscapes are now nationally rare, quite hidden, and breathtakingly beautiful.


  Rather than physical installations on site, the Virtual Art Trail is accessible online. Each artwork can be experienced through your phone or device as you walk through the reserves.
