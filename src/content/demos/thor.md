title: Thor and Co Building
description:
  Matthew Aaron-Fasa Fainuu, a proud Samoan and the cherished local legend of Avondale, launched Thor & Co Building amid the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.


  With a steadfast commitment to his community, Matthew has not only built structures but has also forged strong connections with his clients, significantly enhancing the communal spirit.


  A devoted family man at heart, he integrates his values of kinship and integrity into every project, striving to strengthen and uplift the neighbourhood one build at a time.

  His approach goes beyond construction; it's about creating lasting bonds and a resilient community foundation.
