description: We worked with Tim Max to build out his personal coaching website which showcases his life story that took him from the streets and into professional coaching. Here's a quick bio of Tim - "Tim grew up surrounded by street gangs, involved in crime throughout his teenage years. Addiction to drugs and alcohol took hold, leading to a life without structureâ€”just moving through each day on autopilot. Stuck in jobs that didn't feel right but seemed like the only option, the idea of anything beyond a 9-to-5 cycle felt out of reach."
