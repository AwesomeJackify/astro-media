  NAU MAI, HAERE MAI. Ia OrƒÅna, Welcome to Ata Ahi Fitness & Wellbeing


  Our members enjoy a quiet, uncrowded, chilled vibe in our gym studio with access to the complex's heated indoor lap pool (25m) and rooftop tennis court. You'll notice that our coaches genuinely care about our clients and never try to do the 'hard sell' on anyone. If we don't think we're the right fit for you, we'll suggest a gym that is.


  Unfortunately as on June 2024, Adele had to shut down the gym as business was not doing well due to the recession. She has now moved to the cook islands and is now an owner of a plantation. She hopes to reopen the gym in the future in the cook islands.
